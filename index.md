## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="rony.jpg">

**Hi, I am Rony Shaji ðŸ‘‹**
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a recent Master's graduate in Automotive Engineering from **Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt**. I am passionate about autonomous driving and enjoy coding in C++. Currently, I am working as a research assistant, focusing on ADAS simulation and V2X communication. In this role, I develop and implement a software stack written in C++ for optimal communication between cars and infrastructure. I also work with various hardware components, such as sensors (LIDAR, cameras), Roadside Units (RSU), and embedded devices.

With over 2 years of experience in software development, I have worked with agile software development teams and used tools like Git, JIRA, CMake, Jenkins, and more. Participating in code reviews, sprint meetings, real-time troubleshooting, and software deployment excites me greatly.

Additionally, I have experience with machine learning, particularly in Deep Learning, through lectures and various projects. I am excited to work on interesting projects in the automotive domain in the future.
