### **Research Assistant**  
**Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Germany**  
_Sep 2024 - Present_

- **COHDA Embedded Device**: Worked with the COHDA embedded software stack in C to optimize the deserialization of V2X messages.
- **V2X Software Stack (ETSI, ROS, C++)**: Developed and implemented a high-level C++-based V2X stack in ROS for communication between infrastructure and vehicles, including the use of FlatBuffers (serialization) on NVIDIA Orin.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved CPM communication efficiency by 10% through the implementation of the ETSI TS 103 324 standard and advanced C++ programming techniques.
- **Real-time Testing**: Tested CAM, CPM, and DENM V2X messages on a sensor-based test field using prototype cars.
- **User Interface**: Developed an OpenStreetMap-based GUI for visualizing detected objects.
